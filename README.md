# ArtemisLiteG6
ArtemisLite - Software Engineering Project 2022

About Artemis Project:
The primary operations goal of the mission is to assure a safe crew module entry, descent, splashdown, and recovery. In addition to sending Orion on its journey around the Moon, SLS will carry 10 small satellites that will perform their own science and technology investigations. The first in a series of increasingly complex missions, Artemis I will provide a foundation for human deep space exploration and demonstrate our commitment and capability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond prior to the first flight with crew on Artemis II. 

Group 6 - Project outline:
As a team we will be designing a game based on the Artemis Project using Java as our coding language, supported by a UML diagram of the games' outline/flow and user story scenarios.
The final output of our project will consist of a technical report discussing the progression of code, requirements, testing and final product design and functionality, a master UML diagram surrounding the game including alternative routes (error management), a working set of code that will encompass our game plan/UML diagram.
